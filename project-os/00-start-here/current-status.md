# Current Status

## Summary

TaxiFlow Pro is currently in a production-hardening release phase on draft PR #2. The feature branch has replaced premature client-side success reporting for live Supabase mutations with confirmed persistence patterns, hardened Owner-first authentication and user lifecycle handling, standardised the live workspace contract, added password recovery, and preserved the existing finance workflow. Application logic is already substantially implemented; the remaining work is release validation and controlled rollout, not product redesign.

## Working Branch

`agent/owner-first-auth-reset`

Draft PR: `#2 — Harden production auth and reset to Owner-first access`

Do not merge this branch to `main` until the release gates below are satisfied.

## What Exists

- Production-oriented Supabase Auth with Owner-first access.
- `appUsers` membership enforced in addition to a valid Auth session.
- Coordinated Auth + workspace user lifecycle for create/update/delete/reset-password operations.
- Canonical `taxiflow-live` workspace contract shared by browser/server code.
- Owner-gated idempotent workspace bootstrap.
- Confirmed live persistence patterns for route, driver, fleet, finance, and reachable password-reset-request mutations.
- Finance workflow preserved as `pending -> counted -> verified -> banked`.
- Supabase native password recovery flow with dedicated password-update UX.
- Viewer role intentionally remains demo/mock-data only.
- Vercel Preview deployment exists for the feature branch.
- Reviewed `appUsers` RLS migration exists at `supabase/migrations/20260810_protect_workspace_appusers.sql` but has intentionally not yet been applied to production.

## What Is Proven

According to the current PR validation record:

- Route persistence tests: 18 passing.
- Driver persistence tests: 28 passing.
- Fleet persistence tests: 21 passing.
- Finance persistence tests: 25 passing.
- User lifecycle/concurrency tests: 17 passing.
- Workspace bootstrap tests: 10 passing.
- Final mutation sweep tests: 6 passing.
- Password recovery tests: 20 passing.
- Total Node behavioural suite: 163/163 passing.
- `npm run build` clean.
- `npm run test:sync-guards` passing.
- No plaintext live password is intended to persist in the workspace snapshot.
- Production and Preview no longer depend on the stale `SUPABASE_WORKSPACE_KEY` environment variable.

These results must be re-checked if implementation changes materially after this status entry.

## What Is Incomplete

1. Final Preview user-acceptance testing has not been recorded as complete.
2. Password recovery still needs an end-to-end Preview smoke test to confirm Supabase recovery-email delivery and redirect allow-list behaviour.
3. A representative authenticated lifecycle/persistence flow should be verified after hard refresh.
4. The finance workflow should be verified on Preview through `pending -> counted -> verified -> banked` after hard refresh.
5. The reviewed `appUsers` RLS migration must only be applied after the hardened application is merged/deployed and confirmed, followed by a short production smoke test.
6. Playwright E2E was attempted but browser launch was blocked because the installed bundle lacks `chromium_headless_shell`; no forced browser installation was performed.
7. GitHub Actions is not currently an enforced PR check.

## Current Blockers

- Human/real-browser Preview UAT is the primary release gate.
- End-to-end recovery email/redirect behaviour depends on live Supabase Auth URL configuration and must be verified in the deployed Preview environment.
- Full Playwright browser automation is unavailable in the recorded environment until the required browser runtime is installed or another browser-validation route is used.

## Known Risks

- Applying the `appUsers` RLS migration before the hardened client is deployed could break the currently deployed pre-PR production client.
- Merging before Preview UAT would promote a security/persistence hardening release without the final real-browser acceptance pass.
- Any future mutation path that reports success before canonical remote verification could reintroduce the persistence defect this PR is designed to eliminate.
- Auth-only identities must never be treated as authorised TaxiFlow users without an active `appUsers` record.

## Non-Negotiables

- Preserve Owner protections against in-app deletion/demotion.
- Preserve the canonical `taxiflow-live` workspace contract.
- Preserve the finance lifecycle exactly as `pending -> counted -> verified -> banked` unless a separately approved business change says otherwise.
- Do not persist live passwords or recovery tokens in workspace data.
- Do not weaken Supabase Auth, appUsers membership checks, RLS, concurrency protection, or server-side lifecycle coordination for convenience.
- Do not merge/deploy production merely because automated Node tests pass; complete the applicable release validation first.
